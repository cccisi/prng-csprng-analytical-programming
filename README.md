# PRNGsAnalysis
Ernesto Cesaro's Theorem can be used to statistically approximate the value of Pi. 
A comparison of various Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) will be performed to determine the randomness of each based on the resulting estimate of Pi. 
This will be talking about heuristic PRNGs and CSPRNGs.
CSPRNGs are considered to be talked. All source codes are considered and modified from others to be deterministic.
